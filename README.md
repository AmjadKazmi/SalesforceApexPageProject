## 🧩 Use Case

**HowWeRoll Rentals**, the world’s largest RV rental company, is scaling rapidly across the globe. With a massive fleet of recreational vehicles (RVs), the company offers top-tier rental and roadside assistance services.

However, with growth comes complexity—especially in maintaining RVs. Routine service checks and emergency repairs are critical to ensuring customer safety and preventing costly breakdowns.

You’ve been hired as the **Lead Salesforce Developer** to build a scalable, automated service maintenance system that:
- Flags vehicles needing routine maintenance or repair
- Allows support staff to view and manage service cases
- Syncs Salesforce with a separate inventory management system

## 🛠️ Project Features

This solution primarily leverages **Apex**, but to enhance user experience and demonstrate a modern UI, a **Lightning Web Component (LWC)** has been developed with the following features:

### ✅ Key Functionalities

- **Drag-and-Drop Case Management**:  
  View and manage cases visually by dragging case cards across status columns to update their state.

- **Hover Details for Cases**:  
  Hovering over a case card reveals associated product details in a dynamic tooltip.

- **Status Summary Table**:  
  Displays real-time counts of cases grouped by each status category.

- **Create New Case Form**:  
  Allows users to create a new maintenance case and associate multiple products to it.
